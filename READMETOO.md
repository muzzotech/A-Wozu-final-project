So here is where I got.

I can submit a task and it will appear below Tasks:
I've tried a number of ways to get a task to delete but to no avail.
I've even tried to get stuff out of the tasksservice.ts to try and get the item to delete, but nothing.

I never got to update a task as I ran out of time as I got so mired in trying to get the thing to delete. Hopefully, this will count as some effort. I do plan on coming back to this as I want it to work.

Anyways, that's my story and I'm sticking to it.
